# SQL-hands-on-practice

I have developed understanding of SQL through various exercises and practical applications. My experience covers essential aspects of SQL, starting with basic data retrieval queries using the SELECT and WHERE clauses. I have learned how to define key attributes and apply various constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE, ensuring data integrity within database tables.

I gained hands-on experience in creating and modifying database schemas, constructing tables, and imposing necessary constraints. Additionally, I am proficient in writing subqueries and performing join operations, utilizing different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to retrieve data from multiple related tables. I have also learned how to create and manage views for abstracting complex queries and improving query efficiency.

Moreover, I am familiar with using advanced clauses such as GROUP BY and HAVING for grouping and filtering aggregated data, enabling more sophisticated data analysis. This comprehensive experience has provided me with a strong foundation in SQL and its practical application in managing and querying relational databases.
